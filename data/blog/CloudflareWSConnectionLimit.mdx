## 1 Background

One day, I receive that some services is down, and some users also reports that they can not connect with our services

This services cluster is load balance by `Cloudflare LoadBalancing`, and I set alert configuration in cloudflare, but I did not receive any alert from cloudflare, that so weird.

so I use this command to do health check for our service:

```bash
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/vi/websocat wss://testnet-rpc.cess.network/ws/
```

and it just returns a message: <span style={{color: 'red'}}>502 bad gateway</span>


## 2 Reason

So I just `ssh` to the real host and check the chain service log, and I found all backend services is work fine.


**Service log as below:**
![RpcNodeLog](/static/images/2024-07/RpcNodeLog.png)

The container log seems that this service works fine, and then, I check the others services, and it also works fine.

I search the `cloudflare community` for help and finally got it. The reason why the backend services has no problem but still `returns 502` is because of the [Cloudflare Concurrent Connection Limit](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/cloudflare-websocket-limits/57455/4)

but it still got a little difference, I got `502 err code` and the others guys got `503 err code`, maybe cloudflare has updated `the err code return` after 2019.

When I calculated all my services concurrent connection and found that: <span style={{color: 'red'}}>cloudflare support almost 40000+ concurrent websocket connections for my services for free</span>, that is amazing.

## 3 Solution

- Solution1: Restart all backend services and disrupt all connections, make the concurrent websocket connections number re-calculate from zero

- Solution2: Upgrade domain to Pro edition, according to the community, Pro edition can give roughly a 5x increase over Free edition, and business a similar increase.

Finally, I spend `240$` to upgrade domain to `pro edition`, and the services restore after 10 min.(maybe we should upgrade to business to get more services)



## 4 Summary

In the chain mainland, we call `Cloudflare` as `赛博佛祖` or `赛博义父` because its free services like `warp`, `pages`,`workers`...

I believe most developers behind the great fire wall hope that Cloudflare will get better and better.

---

Currently, we spend over $1,000 on Cloudflare every year, and it will increase in the future. We are willing to pay for quality services, not just to be a freeloader.

The last earning report caused cloudflare stock price `#net` to fall a lot ,and I hope this upcoming earnings report will bring good news
