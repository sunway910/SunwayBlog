## 1 Enable Load Balance Feature

## 2 Import a Certificate

You can import your own certificate to implement your custom https connection

## 3 Create a Virtual Server

### Create a http virtual server
If you do not have your own certificate and do not want to use fortigate default certificate, you can set to `http` type

### Create a https virtual server
If you import your own certificate, your can set to `https` type and select your own certificate; otherwise, your can use fortigate default certificate to implement a https connection

**SSL Mode:**
- `Client <-> FortiGate`: Client(https) --> Fortigate(https) --> Server(http)
- `Full`: Client(https) --> Fortigate(https) --> Server(https)

## 4 Redirect http to https

Add a Firewall Policy to redirect 80 to 443 so that client can auto access to https://uat.example.com from  http://uat.example.com

## 5 Use virtual server to create firewall policy

You must select `Proxy-based` mode so that you can find `virtual server` in policy `Destination`

## 6 Add DNS Record

Add `uat.example.com` and `prd.example.com`'s type A resolution to Fortigate WAN IP.

## 7 Summary
Finally, you can implement an architecture like that:

In my case, the IP `10.210.0.2` is a real server in internal network, but IP `10.210.11.170` is a SLB in AlibabaCloud
