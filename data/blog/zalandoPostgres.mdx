<TOCInline toc={props.toc}/>

A comprehensive YAML template guide for deploying PostgreSQL clusters on Kubernetes using the Zalando Postgres Operator.

## Introduction

The Zalando Postgres Operator is a powerful tool for managing PostgreSQL clusters on Kubernetes. It provides high-availability, scalability, and automated operations including backups, failovers, and monitoring. This guide explores the deployment options and configuration best practices.

## How to Install

First, you'll need to install the Postgres Operator using Helm. The following commands customize the operator configuration to improve high-availability through pod anti-affinity settings.

```shell
helm repo add postgres-operator-charts https://opensource.zalando.com/postgres-operator/charts/postgres-operator

helm install postgres-operator postgres-operator-charts/postgres-operator -n default \
--set configKubernetes.enable_pod_antiaffinity=true \
--set configKubernetes.pod_antiaffinity_preferred_during_scheduling=true \
--set configKubernetes.pod_antiaffinity_topology_key="topology.ebs.csi.aws.com/zone"

# Install the optional UI component for easier management
helm repo add postgres-operator-ui-charts https://opensource.zalando.com/postgres-operator/charts/postgres-operator-ui
helm install postgres-operator-ui postgres-operator-ui-charts/postgres-operator-ui -n default

# Retrieve the auto-generated password for the PostgreSQL superuser
kubectl get secret -n deapp sunway.sunway-postgres.credentials.postgresql.acid.zalan.do -o 'jsonpath={.data.password}' | base64 -d
```



## Deployment Options

### Cluster Only

This configuration deploys a PostgreSQL cluster without integrated monitoring. You'll need to deploy exporters separately if monitoring is required.

```yaml
apiVersion: "acid.zalan.do/v1"
kind: postgresql

## Understanding the Generated Services

After successful deployment, the Zalando Postgres Operator creates four distinct Kubernetes services to access your PostgreSQL cluster:

```text
sunway-postgres                    connect to master(r/w) node directly
sunway-postgres-pooler             connect to master(r/w) node via pooler
sunway-postgres-repl               connect to slave(r) node directly
sunway-postgres-pooler-repl        connect to slave(r) node via pooler
```

## Advanced User Management

If you need to create additional users after deployment, you can use standard PostgreSQL commands to create roles with appropriate permissions:

```postgresql
-- Create a read-only access role
CREATE ROLE readaccess;
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE decloud TO readaccess;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO readaccess;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO readaccess;
CREATE USER read_only_user WITH PASSWORD 'SecurePassword123';
GRANT readaccess TO read_only_user;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO readaccess;

-- Create a monitoring user for Prometheus
CREATE USER postgres_exporter WITH PASSWORD 'SecurePassword123';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE decloud TO postgres_exporter;
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE postgres TO postgres_exporter;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO postgres_exporter;
GRANT pg_monitor TO postgres_exporter;
```
